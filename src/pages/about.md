# About
Hey! My name is `Jack Daus`. Iâ€™m a full-time software developer building AR/VR applications. I'm also a computer science masters student at George Mason University. On this site, I am writing tutorials for AR/VR development. You can also find some info about my personal projects. This website was build with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) (which I highly recommend).
