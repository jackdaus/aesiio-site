# About
Hey! My name is `Jack Daus`. Iâ€™m a software developer interested in building augmented reality (AR) applications. I'm also a graduate student at George Mason University over in Virginia. Welcome to my site! I write tutorials about AR techonology and host some info about my personal projects. This website was build with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
